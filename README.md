## Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to classify data using using Linear Regression. The notebook documents the end-to-end process from initial data loading and exploratory analysis to model tuning and comparative performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies target variables based on input features. The notebook explores multiple machine learning architectures to identify the most effective solution for the given dataset.

## Key Features
Comprehensive Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling , and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand feature distributions and correlations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python.

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy.

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn.

Machine Learning: scikit-learn.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
